"""Pass-A spike: per-segment ad-ness judgments via TypeSafe Jev.

Asks one Noul per transcript segment ("is this line advertising?") over a
window of transcript state, then recovers ad spans from the resulting
probability curve by taking contiguous runs. Every boundary is a real
segment edge, so no timestamp is ever generated.

Scoring reuses ``metrics`` so numbers are comparable to the chat-model rows
in ``results/report.md``.
