Ranking uses the @0.5 column; the @0.8 column re-scores the identical predictions where a match must line up on the boundaries, so a large drop between the two means the rank is an artifact of loose matching rather than accurate cuts. `n/a` means the row carries no strict-threshold scores. |\n"

Treat as a load/availability indicator, not a model-quality signal. |\n"
        "| **JSON compliance** | 0 to 1 | higher is better | Fraction of responses that parsed as a clean JSON array matching the requested schema. 1.0 = always clean; lower = used object wrappers (`{ads: [...]}`), markdown fences, extra fields like `sponsor`, or required regex fallback to extract. |\n"

Reads from `json_format_used` in `calls.jsonl`. Useful when picking a model whose provider may not support native JSON mode -- a strong `JSON compliance` score from a `prompt-inject` model carries different weight than the same score from a `native` model. |\n\n"

We use IoU >= 0.5 as the threshold for a predicted ad to count as matching a truth ad.\n- **Per-break canonicalization**: before matching, predicted and truth spans separated by gaps under 15 seconds are merged, so one span means one contiguous ad break. This mirrors the detection prompt's own merge rule; a model that reports one break as several adjacent spots is not penalized for the split.\n"
